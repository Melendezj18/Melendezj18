  I am a Software Engineer and lifelong learner who loves to code. I have a lot of patience and problem solving skills and a drive to learn which help me fill in the gaps in teams and learn quickly. My time as a driver helped me become very accustomed to meeting tight deadlines and working under stress. Being in the track team and other extracurricular groups helped to make me a friendly team player with the ability to de-escalate situations and to look at problems from multiple angles to find solutions and pivot through different methods of problem solving. With all the challenges I have faced I gained a determination that wont let me fail. I'm excited to experience the hardware side of programming.

## Stub-Crud Event Registration App

### Mongoose/Express/React/Node Team project.

An event registration app for an adventure race that I organize built with a team.  I was the Lead Back End developer, as well as Deployment Manager.   [Jose Melendez](https://github.com/Melendezj18) was the GitHub manager and handled front end functionality, [Edward Ho](https://github.com/Speckoh) was Lead Front End and styling, and [Tim Martinson](https://github.com/TimMMartinson) was our Scrum Master and worked on Front End styling.
